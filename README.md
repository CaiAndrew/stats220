This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Statistics
- I am taking STATS 220 because I need the credits
- I am interested in learning about Statistics

I could not think of a gif to replace the previous one so here is a funny cow

You did not specify what I had to put in the README for Project 1, so I am going to ramble into the void about the March 2025 iteration of the **Duelist Cup** in ***Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel*** (I am a huge nerd).  

**DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT, NOR DO I CLAIM TO BE, ACTUALLY GOOD AT YU-GI-OH!, I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE GAME**

# The March 2025 Duelist Cup
The **Duelist Cup** is an in-game event where players compete with one another. It is split into two parts, Stage 1 and Stage 2, where you have to complete Stage 1 in order to participate in Stage 2. Stage 1 is split into twenty levels, and you have to win multiple games in a row to level up. Once you reach level 20, you have effectively cleared Stage 1 and earn the right to participate in Stage 2.  
My goal is usually just to get through Stage 1, as there are not any notable rewards for Stage 2 beyond bragging rights.  

To be completely honest, the current format is terrible. The **Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith** deck is far and away the best deck to play; it is honestly unacceptable how much stronger it is than its contemporaries. Not to mention its price point, this is easily the most expensive a deck has been, making this supremely powerful deck also difficult to access without significant commitment. 



## Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith
This was actually the first deck I started playing when the **Duelist Cup** started; I happened to tangentially be collecting many of the cards needed in the deck for other purposes and unintentionally amassed most of the cards needed. I happened to be a single card off the full deck, so it was hardly an investment to play. Usually, I tend to shy away from meta decks (meta is an acronym for "Most Effective Tactic Available") since I prefer decks with a slightly lower power level as, in my personal experience, they provide more enjoyable duels. However, the deck I was planning to play, **Centur-Ion**, was missing several important cards compared to the TCG and OCG iterations, despite the fact that Master Duel has imported cards released after those cards did in the respective formats. In other words, **Centur-Ion** was in a weaker state compared to the TCG and OCG formats when **Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith** was available. Thus, I ended up playing **Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith** for the **Duelist Cup**.

### Why stop playing the best deck in the game?
As I alluded to during the previous section, this was the **first** deck I played, meaning that I eventually swapped to another deck. And as mentioned, **Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith** was easily the best deck in the game. So why did I eventually choose to switch to another deck?  
There were four main reasons for this:
1. **The deck is exhausting to play**
   - The deck just goes and goes, spinning its wheels for an inordinate amount of time, even for one-sided blowout duels. It also has many non-linear  lines, forcing you to constantly think about your actions throughout the entirety of your turns. The combination of long turns and non-linear lines means that the deck is mentally taxing to play, which is a detriment for a ladder system where you have to win multiple games consecutively to level up. The mental fatigue building up quickly also meant that I had to take constant breaks in order to prevent it from tanking my level of play, further increasing the amount of time I needed for each duel.
2. **The deck is highly subject to counterplay due to being a known quantity**
   - It is no secret that **Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith** is the best deck in the game, so naturally, it means that most players will tailor their decks specifically to beat this deck. The deck, whilst definitely strong enough to play through commonly used cards such as [*Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=12950) and [*Infinite Impermanence*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=13631), is not so strong that it has no counterplay. The most notorious one that has risen in usage for this purpose is [*Retaliating "C"*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=11829), which completely shuts down all three parts of the deck if you start with the **Azamina** part of the deck since they all need access to the Graveyard in order to function. This is especially an issue as you would normally want to use [*The Hallowed Azamina*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=20529) at the start of your turn in order to access the other parts of the deck through [*Azamina Mu Rcielago*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=20507) or to insulate your turn by summoning [*Azamina Ilia Silvia*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=20506) for an omni-negate. To add further insult to injury, you don't even get to summon either of them as it needs to send to graveyard as cost. And if you end up sending the *Retaliating "C"* to the graveyard, it searches [*Maxx "C"*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=9455). Which leads us to...
3. **Maxx "C" and Mulcharmy Fuwalos**
   - [*Maxx "C"*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=9455) and [*Mulcharmy Fuwalos*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=20500) are both cards that give your opponents extra cards for performing special summons, which **Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith** has to do a lot of in most hands. Thus, if you don't draw a card in your opening hand to deal with one, or even both, then your turn functionally ends there, and you have to hope you can survive until your next turn. 
4. **I keep drawing my garnets**
   - This one is just a bit of personal experience and is not really an indictment against that deck. That being said, my singular copy of [*Snake-Eyes Poplar*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=19467) is glued to my opening hand in a 45 card deck, and I'm tired of losing a huge chunk of my  before it even begins. "Garnets" are cards that you don't want to have in your opening hand, as they lose some or all of their functionality when they are. *Snake-Eyes Poplar* is one of these cards, as you lose out on its ability to special summon itself if it is added to hand **EXCEPT BY DRAWING IT**. I have Normal Summoned one too many *Snake-Eyes Poplar*...

So you dropped **Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith**. What did you switch to then?



## Kashtira Bystial Fiendsmith
This is the deck I ended up on after dropping **Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith** and stayed on for the rest of the **Duelist Cup**. It's a relatively mid-range deck that does not have the seemingly endless turns of **Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith** but can play more effectively on your opponent's first turn. Instead of putting out an unbeatable board, **Kashtira Bystial Fiendsmith** instead aims to out-resource your opponent over a longer game. **Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith** also did not have the room for **Bystial**s, who are well-positioned due to the incredible amount of **Fiendsmith** being played. I really like the **Bystials**, and I simply wanted to play them. Although you are active on both player's turns, the  lines are much more straightfoward and simple, making the deck far less taxing to play. Additionally, it is less susceptible to the same cards that give ***Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith** a hard time. For example: The only card that triggers [*Retaliating "C"*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=11829) is [*Kashtiratheosis*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=18203), a card that you only play at the end of your combo, if at all.

The deck is made up of three main parts:
- **Kashtira**
- **Bystial**
- **Fiendsmith**
The names of these decks could be better...

### The **Kashtira**s:
> Show me that Extra, show me that extra...

**Main Deck:**
- 2x [*Kashtira Unicorn*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=17769)
- 1x [*Kashtira Fenrir*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=17768)
- 1x [*Kashtira Birth*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=17815)
- 1x [*Kashtiratheosis*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=18203)

Honestly, I would play more **Kashtira**s if I could, but *Kashtira Unicorn* and *Kashtira Fenrir* are limited to 2 and 1 copies, respectively. They're fantastic going first and second, special summon themselves onto an empty field without activating a chain, bait out hand traps incredibly well, provide additional bodies for the **Fiendsmith** part of the deck, especially in combination with *Kashtira Birth*, and *Kashtira Unicorn*'s Extra Deck rip gives knowledge of what your opponent is playing turn 1 and lets you get rid of key combo pieces. *Kashtira Birth* is an incredibly strong card that threatens follow-up on future turns and can even tamper with your opponent's graveyard under the right conditions, but only works with **Kashtira** monsters, of which we only play three. So for as strong as it is, we only play a single copy of *Kashtira Birth* as it can be searched by *Kashtira Unicorn*. Normally, the **Kashtira** package contains a [*Pressured Planet Wraitsoth*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=18204) in place of the *Kashtiratheosis*. I will not deny the possibility of this being better; I just want to say that I have a reason for this. 
- *Pressured Planet Wraitsoth* is an addiational copy of either of the **Kashtira**s, but this telegraphs to your opponent that your next action will be to summon a **Kashtira**, giving them the ability to use their [*Maxx "C"*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=9455) or [*Mulcharmy Fuwalos*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=20500) if they haven't already, before *Kashtira Unicorn* is summoned and is able to rip a card from their Extra Deck. 
- *Kashtiratheosis* is used since the main purpose of the **Kashtira**s is to bait out hand traps. Due to how strong *Kashtira Birth* is, *Kashtira Unicorn* is a common target for hand traps when it activates its effect to add a **Kashtira** spell. However, this means that most people will not use a hand trap until *Kashtira Unicorn* activates its effect, meaning that a *Kashtira Unicorn* that is not using its effect is unable to bait hand traps. This is the reason why *Kashtiratheosis* is in the deck, as an additional search target for *Kashtira Unicorn* in the case where you draw *Kashtira Birth*. Since your hand is obscured from your opponent, they are likely to believe that a *Kashtira Unicorn* attempting to use its effect is trying to add *Kashtira Birth* and will use hand traps to stop it, allowing *Kashtira Unicorn* to bait out hand traps when you already have *Kashtira Birth* in hand. Even in the case where they do not hand trap *Kashtira Unicorn*, *Kashtiratheosis* can still be used at the end of a combo to summon *Kashtira Fenrir* as an additional source of disruption if *Kashtira Unicorn* is still on field.

### The **Bystial**s:
> I'm gonna banish a light and a dark...

**Main Deck:**
- 1x [*Bystial Magnamhut*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=17762)
- 3x [*Bystial Saronir*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=17763)
- 3x [*Bystial Druiswurm*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=17764)
- 3x [*Bystial Baldrake*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=18149)
- 3x [*The Bystial Lubellion*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=17765)
- 1x [*Branded Regained*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=17808)
- 1x [*Branded Beast*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=17828)

These guys are the main reason I wanted to pick up this deck. **Fiendsmith** is everywhere, including this deck and the previous one I played, and the **Bystial**s match up well into it. Additionally, they also have good matchups into **Azamina**, **Blue-Eyes** and basically every deck that uses Light and Dark Attribute monsters, which is most of them. The level 6 **Bystial**s (the first four in the list) perform double duty as hand traps and additional bodies on field, either as additional bodies for the **Fiendsmith** part of the deck or just as 2500 ATK beaters. As such, I have chosen to run as many copies of the level 6 **Bystial** monsters as possible to make it as likely as possible to see them on the first turn. Some people might cut down on copies of *The Bystial Lubellion*since it doesn't share the ability to summon itself by banishing a Light or Dark Attribute monster from the graveyard. I opted to run the max number of copies since he searches any of the other **Bystial**s, can be used as a **Bystial** target in a pinch if the extra body is needed, and most importantly, puts a **Branded** Continuous Spell or Trap card directly onto the field. *Branded Regained* is easily the best card in the deck and is almost always the first one you get with *The Bystial Lubellion*. It provides insane amounts of recursion and functionally lets you trade favourably against almost every deck. *Branded Beast* could be cut if you wanted to, as it is simply not nearly as strong as *Branded Regained*, but I kept it since it can be used to bluff getting *Branded Regained* with *The Bystial Lubellion*, similar to *Kashtiratheosis* for *Kashtira Unicorn*, and recover *Branded Regained* from the grave.  
Unfortunately, using **Bystial**s on your opponent's turn means that there's a body on your side of the field, turning off the ability for the **Kashtira**s to special summon themselves. This is just something I have come to terms with and is an unfortunate part of the deck. The most you can do is hope that your opponent clears your **Bystial**/s for you and turns on your **Kashtira**s.

### The **Fiendsmith**s:
> Any two monsters...
> 
**Main Deck:**
- 2x [*Fiendsmith Engraver*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=20196)
- 1x [*Fiendsmith's Tract*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=20240)
- 1x [*Fabled Lurrie*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=8092)

**Extra Deck:**
- 1x [*Fiendsmith's Requiem*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=20225)
- 1x [*Fiendsmith's Sequence*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=20226)
- 1x [*Fiendsmith's Lacrima*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=20214)
- 1x [*Fiendsmith's Desirae*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=20215)
- 1x [*D/D/D Wave High King Caesar*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=13081)
- 1x [*Moon of the Closed Heaven*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=19932)

You might remember mentions in the previous sections about bodies for the **Fiendsmith** part of the deck. The reason why **Fiendsmith** is being used in most decks is because of how accessible and flexible it is. It takes up little space in the Main Deck and is accessible if you have two/three bodies on field depending on if one is a Light Attribute Fiend monster, so most decks with a couple of spare slots in the Extra Deck can run the **Fiendsmith** cards as play extension or as end board pieces depending on the situation. In this deck, we are running the bare minimum amount of **Fiendsmith** cards: two copies of *Fiendsmith Engraver*, one copy of *Fiendsmith's Tract*, and one copy of *Fabled Lurrie*. Two is the maximum number of *Fiendsmith Engraver* we can run, and is also currently the only target for *Fiendsmith's Requiem*, so we run two. *Fiendsmith's Tract* is the singular search target for *Fiendsmith Engraver*'s in-hand effect, but we only ever need one since a single use of *Fiendsmith's Tract* gives us access to full **Fiendsmith** combo for the rest of the duel. *Fabled Lurrie* might seem out of place, as it is not a **Fiendsmith** card, but synergises greatly with *Fiendsmith's Tract*, as it can add *Fabled Lurrie* to hand and immediately discard it, special summoning it from the grave and fulfilling the Light Attribute Fiend requirement for full **Fiendsmith** combo. Even if you already have *Fabled Lurrie* in hand, when you activate *Fiendsmith's Tract*, it can discard any card of your choosing, so you can still discard *Fabled Lurrie* to special summon it.  

We only need a single copy of each of the Extra Deck **Fiendsmith** monsters, as they get continuously shuffled back into the deck as part of normal **Fiendsmith** gameplay, letting you use a single copy over and over throughout a single duel. *Fiendsmith's Requiem is the bridge to the rest of the **Fiendsmith** combo and requires only a single Light Attribute Fiend to summon, letting any deck access the **Fiendsmith** cards if they can put a Light Attribute Fiend on field. If we draw *Fiendsmith Engraver* or *Fiendsmith's Tract*, we can get *Fabled Lurrie* on field to make *Fiendsmith's Requiem* and perform full **Fiendsmith** combo. However, in the case where we don't draw either, we can instead summon *Moon of the Closed Heaven* instead using any two Effect Monsters, which is a Light Attribute Fiend that can make *Fiendsmith's Requiem* for full **Fiendsmith** combo. Unfortunately, we are currently missing cards like [*Necroquip Princess*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=20423) and [*Lacrima the Crimson Tears*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=20490) which provide the ability to get an additional body on field for the summon of *Fiendsmith's Sequence*, so we need an additional body from the **Kashtira** or **Bystial** parts of the deck for full **Fiendsmith** combo. That being said, it is still worth playing the **Fiendsmith** cards due to how repeatable they are, as well as how strong *Fiendsmith's Desirae* is, an untargetable monster with the ability to negate up to two face-up cards on field without targeting. That is not to say that *Fiendsmith's Lacrima* is not incredibly strong as well, giving you the ability to recover Light Attribute Fiends from the Banishment as a backup plan if you are unable to make *Fiendsmith's Desirae* if your *Fiendsmith Engraver* is banished, such as from an opposing **Bystial**. *D/D/D Wave High King Caesar* is the monster you make in the *Fiendsmith's Lacrima* line and is an auto-win against certain matchups. Also, the 1200 damage burn from *Fiendsmith's Lacrima* can come up and has been helpful in closing out duels.  

### The Rest of the Deck
Due to how strong **Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith** is when going first and uninterrupted, as well as how resilient their End Boards are to Board Breakers, the most effective way to stop them when you're going second is to use hand traps and prevent them from fully setting up. This deck has the ability to play many hand traps due to the **Bystial**s performing double duty as hand traps and main gameplan, as well as the **Kashtira** and **Fiendsmith** cards taking up little space in the main deck. The goal for the rest of the deck is to have cards that are live on my opponent's turn as much as possible, meaning that I have chosen to cut powerful cards like [*Called by the Grave*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=13619) and [*Crossout Designator*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=14627) since they can only be used during and after your first turn. 

***hand traps:***  
**Main Deck:**  
- 2x [*Maxx "C"*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=9455)
- 3x [*Mulcharmy Fuwalos*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=20500)
- 3x [*Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=12950)
- 3x [*Effect Veiler*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=8933)
- 2x [*Nibiru, the Primal Being*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=14741)
- 1x [*Droll & Lock Bird*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=9279)

*Maxx "C"* and *Mulcharmy Fuwalos*:  
These are the only two cards that are able to stop **Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith** from setting up fully, so we play as many copies of both as possible. Even though *Mulcharmy Fuwalos* requires an empty field to use, making it dead when you go first, it can still be summoned as an extra body for **Fiendsmith** since the **Kashtira**s and **Bystial**s usually do not need your Normal Summon.

*Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring*:  
Although this deck is not as weak to *Maxx "C"* and *Mulcharmy Fuwalos* as **Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith*, they still draw a good number of cards from your normal plays. Thus why we play the maximum number of copies of *Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring* since it can directly negate those cards. Even when your opponent does not have those cards, it still has many applications in almost every matchup, such as negating the effect of a *Fiendsmith's Tract*.

*Effect Veiler* but no *Infinite Impermanence*?:  
*Effect Veiler* can stop your opponent's monsters on the field from resolving their effects during their, can be used consecutively if you have multiple in hand, and is a Light Attribute monster that discards itself for cost, letting you use it as a **Bystial** target. I have chosen to run three copies of *Effect Velier* and zero copies of [*Infinite Impermanence*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=13631), which also has the ability negate the effects of monsters on the field during your opponent's turn and used in multiples. Although *Infinite Impermanence* has benefits over *Effect Veiler* by not turning on the effect of [*Triple Tactics Talent*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=15296) and [*Triple Tactics Thrust*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=18214) and being live during every phase of the turn during both player's turns if your field is empty, unlike *Effect Veiler* which is only live during the Main Phase of your opponent's turn, I have chosen to only use *Effect Veiler* since it plays more nicely with the **Bystial**s. A quarter of the deck are **Bystial**s, which put a monster on the field, turning off *Infinite Impermanence*. While you could always use it before summoning a **Bystial**, sometimes you do not get the chance to, making *Infinite Impermanence* a dead card in hand, whereas *Effect Veiler* could still be used when a **Bystial** on field. Additionally, although it hurts to turn on your opponent's *Triple Tactics Talent* and *Triple Tactics Thrust*, the **Bystial**s would already turn those cards on.

*Nibiru, the Primal Being*:  
*Nibiru, the Primal Being* on its own is usually not enough to stop **Azamina Snake-Eye Fiendsmith**, but in combination with another hand trap is frequently enough to end their turn, which we are playing many of. Additionally, it summons itself to your side of the field, giving you a body to use when your turn comes around and leaves a token on theirs. This is yet another reason why I have chosen not to run [*Infinite Impermanence*](https://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/card_search.action?ope=2&cid=13631), as the *Nibiru, the Primal Being* would prevent it from being activated from hand. It synergises particularly well with *Maxx "C"* and *Mulcharmy Fuwalos* since they both draw you cards in response to Special Summons, increasing the chance of you seeing it when they play into it and is likely to be live by the time you do see it. Although the token it generates on the enemy field is likely to be extremely large, *Bystial Druiswurm* and *Fiendsmith Engraver* both have the ability to send it to the Graveyard during the course of a normal combo, so it is mostly a non-issue. Another benefit is that since it leaves a token on your opponent's field, it prevents them from using *Mulcharmy Fuwalos* against you on your turn. Despite this, I am only playing two since it turns off the **Kashtira**s, and you can only activate one per turn, meaning that additional copies beyond the first are dead in hand, and it is mainly to draw into by the effect of *Maxx "C"* and *Mulcharmy Fuwalos*. ~~(also I only have two copies)~~

*Droll & Lock Bird*:  
*Droll & Lock Bird* is an auto-win against certain matchups but useless in others since it does not stop the first search from happening. Since I wanted to have as many cards live as possible on my opponent's turn, I have opted to run minimal copies of *Droll & Lock Bird*. The single copy is only for drawing into with *Maxx "C"* and *Mulcharmy Fuwalos*, as it stops both players from drawing. Since these two stack, *Mulcharmy Fuwalos* can even stack with an additional copy of itself, you can draw up to 3 cards for each special summon your opponent performs, resulting in you decking out and losing if your opponent can special summon enough times. The single copy of *Droll & Lock Bird* is to draw into and turn off these effects if needed.

*Blackwing - Steam the Cloak*:  
A Normal Summon that provides three bodies on field if you use it to summon *Salamangreat Almiraj* and use *Blackwing - Steam the Cloak*'s effect to tribute the first token it creates from its Graveyard effect. Allows you to perform full **Fiendsmith** combo on its own and provides a Dark Attribute in the Graveyard for a **Bystial** afterwards.

*Baronne De Fleur*:  
Only made with a normal summoned *Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring* and a **Kashtira** on field to contest an opponent's pre-existing board. After using its targeted destruction effect and omni-negate, can be converted into a **Super Starslayer TY-PHON - Sky Crisis* 
to further pick apart the opponent's board or tagged out into a **Kashtira** or level 6 **Bystial** during the next Standby Phase.

*Constellar Ptolemy M7*:  
Can be made using a combination of the level 6 **Bystials**, *Fiendsmith Engraver*, or *Fiendsmith's Lacrima*. Can add back any monster from the Graveyard, but the main purpose is to add back a **Bystial** before using the battle phase to convert into a *Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder*.

*Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder*:  
Can be summoned on top of *D/D/D Wave High King Caesar* or *Constellar Ptolemy M7* on the turn an XYZ Monster has battled. Used to wipe an opponent's established board, and is effective since most of your cards recur from the Graveyard with relative ease.  

*Super Starslayer TY-PHON - Sky Crisis*:  
Can be summoned to help clean up "gummy" board states with its ability to prevent monsters with 3000 or more ATK from using their effects and its own non-targeting effect to return a monster on the field to the hand. This deck only has a handful of monsters with 3000 or more ATK, and all of them would not be on the field with *Super Starslayer TY-PHON - Sky Crisis* to begin with, making that restriction a non-issue for us. Although its summon prevents you from summoning any other monsters, you can still summon your **Bystial**s on your opponent's turn.

*Salamangreat Almiraj*:  
Exists solely for *Blackwing - Steam the Cloak* to perform full **Fiendsmith** combo or to convert a normal summoned hand trap (besides *Nibiru, the Primal Being*) into a Link Monster to get the on-summon banish of *S:P Little Knight*.

*I:P Masquerena*:  
Made with any additional bodies on field after a combo to summon *S:P Little Knight* or *Underworld Goddess of the Closed World* on your opponent's turn. Being a Link Monster, it provides *S:P Little Knight* with the on-summon banish regardless of what other monster you use to summon it with.

*S:P Little Knight*:  
Extremely flexible, provides the deck with an on-summon banish of any card on either player's field or Graveyard whilst being incredibly difficult to remove, as it can banish a monster on your field and another monster on either field until the End Phase, usually itself, simultaneously disrupting your opponent's plays whilst guaranteeing follow-up on your own turn. The on-summon banish can be used to deal with problematic enemy cards or to trigger *Branded Regained* on your first turn for an additional draw. In the event that it is dealt with, it can be recycled back into the Extra Deck using *Branded Regained* and a **Bystial**. I would play a second copy if I had space.

*Underworld Goddess of the Closed World*:  
The most situational card in the deck, only used to get rid of specific annoying monsters either on your own turn or theirs via *I:P Masquerena*. This is also the intended card to use with *Moon of the Closed Heaven*, which is something that has not ever mattered for me yet, but it theoretically could. The effect to permanently negate all of your opponent's face-up monsters on-summon and negate a summon from the Graveyard are both useful but are not ever the primary reason to summon *Underworld Goddess of the Closed World*.  
You could cut this for another card, like a second copy of *S:P Little Knight*, since you should be able to prevent your opponent from summoning a problematic monster to begin with.
